## What is feather1s

What does "Feather1s" stands for? Feather1s is just a package, which contains all the icons from https://feathericons.com icon pack. These icons are transformed to compound paths so in tools like Fontello (https://fontello.com/) or IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io) there should be no problem with imports.

**1s** suffix stands for stroke-width set to 1 (instead of default value, which is 2)

This package was made to help me as developer use these icons with react-native and I hope it can help you to simplify usage too!

Font is generated using Fontello (http://fontello.com/).
