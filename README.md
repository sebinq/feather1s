## What is feather1s

What does "Feather1s" stands for? Feather1s is just a package, which contains all the icons from https://feathericons.com icon pack. 

These icons are transformed to compound paths so there should be no problem with importing whole icon pack into tools like Fontello (https://fontello.com/) or IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io).

### **1s** suffix stands for stroke-width set to 1 (instead of default value, which is 2)

This package was made to help me as developer use these icons with react-native and I hope it can help you to simplify your workflow too!

Are you interested in using this font inside react-native project? Then [react-native-feather1s](https://github.com/sinodko/react-native-feather1s) package might be helpful to you!

Bundled font is generated using [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) font generator.
